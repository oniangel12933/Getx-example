## Show some :heart: and star the repo to support the project

# Flutter Shopping app example
In this project I use [Getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for State management, [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for HTTP client and [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) for the local database. Products api is for [fakestoreapi](https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api).
This example learn you how to:
- Setup getx and sizer in main.dart
- Initializes hive and registers adapter in main.dart
- Get data from server with dio and parse JSON to a list
- Using getx to show data in listview and how to work with controller
- Save product in cart with hive
